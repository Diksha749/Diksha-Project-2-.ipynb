Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.**\n","\n","Ans.Sure, dictionary keys are important to be immutable because they are used for lookups in the dictionary. If a key were mutable, it could be modified after it was used to add a value to the dictionary. This could lead to unexpected behavior, as the key would no longer match the value that was associated with it.\n","\n","Here's an example to illustrate the importance of immutability for dictionary keys:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wvHZXZYJX_Xa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mutable key (list) causes unexpected behavior\n","person = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob']}  # Mutable key (not recommended)\n","person['name'].append('Charlie')  # Modifying the list mutates the dictionary\n","print(person)  # Output: {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']}\n","\n","# Immutable key (tuple) ensures consistent behavior\n","person = {'name': ('Alice', 'Bob')}  # Immutable key (recommended)\n","# person['name'].append('Charlie')  # This would cause an error (tuples are immutable)\n","print(person)  # Output: {'name': ('Alice', 'Bob')}"],"metadata":{"id":"pPjYOsrJYTpF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the first example, we create a dictionary with a mutable key ('name'). The value associated with this key is a list containing the names \"Alice\" and \"Bob\". After the dictionary is created, we modify the list by appending the name \"Charlie\" to it. This modification also mutates the dictionary, as the list is the key that is used to look up the value. As a result, the dictionary now contains a key-value pair where the key is the list ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'] and the value is the list ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'].\n","\n","In the second example, we create a dictionary with an immutable key ('name'). The value associated with this key is a tuple containing the names \"Alice\" and \"Bob\". Tuples are immutable, so they cannot be modified after they are created. This means that the key in the dictionary cannot be changed after it is added. As a result, the dictionary remains consistent, and the key-value pair remains the same.\n","\n","As you can see from this example, it is important for dictionary keys to be immutable. If keys were mutable, it could lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to reason about the contents of a dictionary. By using immutable keys, you can ensure that your dictionaries are more reliable and easier to work with."],"metadata":{"id":"l-c_iNruYZLF"}}]}
